Welcome to my blog"><p>Hi! As you might have guessed by the site name, my name is Luis and I make stuff when I am not working my full-time office job. I am a Mechanical and Automotive Engineering graduate, but I have always loved making things at home: sometimes just drawings, paintings, or small sculptures. And sometimes I do more technical stuff, like python scripts, small electronic projects with ESP8266 or ESP32, 3D printed objects... you get the idea. I make stuff.</p><p>People who have known me at different moments of my life might remember me for different aspects. For instance:</p><ul><li>In school, I used to be the guy doing hand sketches and drawings</li><li>During my first years of university, I was the guy obsessed with 3D CAD modeling</li><li>While completing my master&apos;s studies, I was the guy who wanted to learn everything about FEM stress analysis - and actually wrote my thesis almost 80% around that.</li></ul><p>But now, 2 years after graduating, I realize that what I really enjoy is learning new stuff and applying it to real problems. If you asked my friends from university almost none of them would think I&apos;d be interested in data analysis, electronics, sensors, IoT, and all that kinds of things. But here I am :) &#xA0;It&apos;s a random mix, for now.</p><p>I plan to use this site to share things that I have learned and little projects that I do in my spare time. Hopefully decently documented so you might find something useful or at least interesting. I might also share more engineering-related content about things I&apos;ve done in the past. There is a double-fold benefit for me: I also plan to use this to organize myself better and have a more structured way to actually complete the projects I start.</p><p>Now, from all the things I will post, about 80% are self-learned, and I am in absolutely no way an expert on any of the topics I will discuss here, but at least I will do my best to point you guys out to useful resources I used for learning myself.</p><p>I have been meaning to publish this for some time now, and I have finally done it (during a week of COVID-19 home isolation). </p><p>Wish me luck! and I hope you have a great day!</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
