Of course, I had the chance to use workstations with shared licenses in the office to continue working in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-based_design#:~:text=Model%2Dbased%20design%20(MBD),%2C%20aerospace%2C%20and%20automotive%20applications.">Model-Based software development</a>. For that kind of activity, you can&apos;t just go around the license problem, since you work on shared files and projects within a team, and you need to produce models (code) that can work within a larger project.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>However, I took the chance to sharpen my Python skills while completing some of the other tasks I had to do, mainly when analyzing data. I could have used other alternatives, like <a href="https://octave.org/">GNU Octave</a> - which even has the same MATLAB syntax, or <a href="https://www.scilab.org/">Scilab</a>. But I wanted to learn more about Python, since it is a <em>general-purpose programming language</em>.</p>
<p>I figured that I could share some of the things I learned, and started to write an article that suddenly was too long for a single post. So this will be an ongoing series of posts. In each entry, I will share a simple but practical example of how to do a certain task with MATLAB, but using Python instead. Probably some of the code can be improved, but I think it can be useful to see these examples if you are a beginner like me.</p>
<p>I think this is important, since Python opens the possibilities for individuals and companies that cannot afford to buy an expensive MATLAB license, or that already using MATLAB but have use cases for which MATLAB can be easily replaced with Python, cutting down the license costs.</p>
<p>MATLAB is still being used widely, especially in the Automotive and Aerospace industries, but the usage of Python has grown dramatically in many different sectors, since it can be used for many other things - like I said, general-purpose. <em>Python cannot really be compared with MATLAB, as they were designed for different purposes</em>, but I will focus on the use cases that can overlap between the two of them.</p>

<p><em>Skip this part if you are not interested in automotive-specific data</em></p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>Extracting and doing the first-level analysis of data from large log files is a very common use case of MATLAB in automotive testing environments - at least from what I&apos;ve seen in three different large companies in Europe. It could be seen as a mundane activity, but it is not straightforward if the files you have are in different formats. Also, &#xA0;it might be something you need to do very frequently. </p><p><strong><em>For this series of posts, I will look at the tasks I learned to do with Python once the data was available in some kind of universal text encoding.</em> </strong>For instance a CSV file or an ASCII file. This is not always obvious, and there were many cases in which I needed to convert <a href="https://support.vector.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&amp;sysparm_article=KB0011536">VECTOR CAN log files </a>or other <a href="https://www.asam.net/standards/detail/mdf/wiki/#:~:text=An%20ASAM%20MDF%20file%20(file,the%20block&apos;s%20purpose%20and%20content.">ASAM standard formats</a> to text, or use some kind of API to be able to work with them in Python or MATLAB. But that will be part of another article later on.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h1 id="how-to-start-using-python">How to start using Python?</h1>
<p>Python can be actually written in any raw text editor, like <a href="https://www.chip.de/downloads/Notepad_12996935.html">Numpad++ </a>, and then run from the Windows command prompt. But you probably don&apos;t want to do that.</p>
<p>If you are coming from MATLAB and want to start using Python, you probably want some kind of user interface or IDE (Integrated Development Environment) to work with. There is no unique or best answer here, so I will just tell you the ones I have tried.</p>
<p>The first thing is, of course, to download and install <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">Python 3 itself</a> (Python 2 is already in an End-of-Life stage and will no longer be supported by new libraries). Then, you can download and install one of the following IDEs:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">Jupyter Labs</a>. Probably the most used interface for working with Python nowadays. It allows you to work on your web browser, and the Jupyter Notebooks allow splitting the code into <em>cells</em> that can be run individually, like we do with MATLAB&apos;s <em>code sections</em>.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.spyder-ide.org/">SPyder IDE</a>. In my opinion, this one provides the closest experience to MATLAB in terms of interface. You can even have a panel to look at the variables you are working with, for example, and interactive plots. You can install add-ins to work with Jupyter Notebooks within the Spyder IDE too.</li>
<li><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a> (VS Code) This is a more general-purpose programming IDE, but has great support for Python, including support for Jupyter Notebooks too.</li>
</ol>
<p>Personally, I prefer to use VS Code since it allows me to work also on other types of programming projects in the same environment, for example when working with Arduino. However, the code examples I will share will work no matter the IDE you are using.</p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h2 id="example-1-simple-time-series-visualization">Example 1: Simple time series visualization</h2>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>Normally, working with MATLAB or not, the first thing to do after loading data from some large file would be to plot a time series of the most interesting data (or signals, if we are talking about a CAN data log file, for example). This way I can at least know what I&#x2019;m dealing with. For this example, I will use this <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SntfHfiLiTw1Oucy80MRuj8r9WnVa807/view?usp=sharing">example file</a>, which contains some CAN data from a Formula Student Electric car.</p><p>If you download the file, you&apos;ll notice that there are missing values on each variable (CAN signal). This happens a lot especially if you have CAN data, which travels in packets, sometimes at different rates. When the data is exported to other formats, there are different ways to handle the different rates of the signals. In some cases, you will get an output file containing data with individual time vectors for each signal. In this case, the user preferred to have a single time base in the exported file, common to all signals, but the drawback is that there are empty values. I personally prefer this way, since it is easier to do time-based analyses with a unique time vector. We just need to handle the empty values.</p><p>To look at this file with MATLAB, I would do something like this:</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><script src="https://gist.github.com/luisdamed/77e6fff0c5cc9f0bd5a082af0535df3d.js"></script><!--kg-card-end: html--><p></p><p>Notice that I extracted the indices of the non-empty values of each signal, and then used that to represent the data. &#xA0;I also did some formatting to the plot to make it understandable. </p><p>I needed to represent data containing information about speed, in rpm, and torque, in Nm. And I wanted to visualize both against the same time scale, in order to understand what happened during the test I am looking at. </p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>This is why I created a tiled layout. I could have used <a href="https://it.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/subplot.html">subplots</a> instead, and the results would have been very similar. Or I could have plotted both speeds and rpm against a single abscissa, but using two different y axes using <code>yyaxis right</code>.</p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>The output will be something like this:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2022/08/MATLAB_figure_timeseries-2.png" class="kg-image" alt="Replacing MATLAB with Python - Part 1" loading="lazy" width="1078" height="701" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2022/08/MATLAB_figure_timeseries-2.png 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1000/2022/08/MATLAB_figure_timeseries-2.png 1000w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2022/08/MATLAB_figure_timeseries-2.png 1078w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Plot of time series data obtained using MATLAB - Image by author</figcaption></figure><p>Simple enough, right? Let&apos;s see what we have to do instead, when using Python.</p><hr><!--kg-card-begin: html--><script src="https://gist.github.com/luisdamed/34eba609e5877f2181dcec84be5190e3.js"></script><!--kg-card-end: html--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>The first difference you&apos;ll notice is that we need to import the Python libraries we&apos;ll use at the start of the code. In this case, we are dealing with data from a text file, so it is a common practice to use the library called Pandas. Although it can be slow for doing complex computations or handling large datasets, there some workarounds.  In general, it is better to do the calculations using another library, Numpy. We simply import those using the <code>import</code> commad before using anything from them.</p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>Then we can read the file, and load the data as a Pandas dataframe. In Python, we have to get used to working with <em>methods</em> other than functions. This will allow us to do different things with the variables we are working with, depending on what type of object (class) they are. For instance, we loaded the data from the file as a dataframe object that we called <code>df</code> (we could have called it anything, like <code>Pikachu</code>, if we wanted, but <code>df</code> is more self-explanatory and a common practice). Then, to extract the non-empty values we use the <code>.</code> notation to access the <code>notnull()</code> method of the dataframe class.</p>
<p>This is different from the function-based approach that I used in the MATLAB script above, where I used the <a href="https://it.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/isnan.html#mw_db2dcfa9-acb4-48e9-a017-ee0c39f1f741"><code>isnan</code></a> function, and it would have worked on either a double array, a scalar, a matrix or a multidimensional array.</p>
<p>However, methods and classes are not unique to Python, they exist in almost any programming language, and even in MATLAB. The difference is how they are used depending on the <em>intent</em> of the language. MATLAB is specific for matrix computations, so it relies heavily on functions, whereas Python has specific libraries for different purposes, and they use both functions and methods to accomplish some tasks. There are also some <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html">built-in functions in Python</a></p>
<p>Next, we create the figure and plot the data. We first need to specify the figure size, otherwise, the default figure dimensions will be too small. In this case, we are using subplots to obtain the following result:</p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2022/08/Python_fig_timeseries-1.jpeg" class="kg-image" alt="Replacing MATLAB with Python - Part 1" loading="lazy" width="1800" height="1200" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2022/08/Python_fig_timeseries-1.jpeg 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1000/2022/08/Python_fig_timeseries-1.jpeg 1000w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1600/2022/08/Python_fig_timeseries-1.jpeg 1600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2022/08/Python_fig_timeseries-1.jpeg 1800w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Plot of time series data obtained using Python (Pyplot) - Image by author</figcaption></figure><p>Granted, the Python plot needs a bit more manual formatting to have the same look as the MATLAB one. But this is not really an issue once you know what you need to change to get the format you want. You can set the defaults for creating figures on the top of your script, or make a function that does the formatting for new figures.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>If you have trouble getting some details to work, you can just google your answer. The amount of Python users is huge <a href="https://ponder.io/pandas-is-now-as-popular-as-python-was-in-2016/#Python%E2%80%99s%20Popularity%20more%20than%20Doubled%20Between%202013%20and%202022">and growing</a>, so it is very likely you will find someone already asked a similar question online. For instance, I was having a hard time getting the axes titles to show correctly, and there was <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6774086/how-to-adjust-padding-with-cutoff-or-overlapping-labels">a Stackoverflow thread</a> solving exactly the same issue - turns out you need to add <code>plt.tight_layout()</code> for the figure to be padded correctly. Just part of the learning curve. It&apos;s like when I needed to call the legend in MATLAB as <code>legend(&apos;interpreter&apos;, &apos;none&apos;)</code> to avoid <em>tex</em> interpretation of variable names with underscores, for instance.</p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>Plus, this example was done using <a href="https://matplotlib.org/stable/tutorials/introductory/pyplot.html#:~:text=pyplot%20is%20a%20collection%20of,In%20matplotlib.">Pyplot</a>. There are other libraries for plotting, which can produce cleaner plots in different cases, depending on your purposes.</p><hr><p>This post was a bit longer than the others, being the introduction of the series, but I hope you found it helpful or at least interesting. Over the next weeks, I will be sharing other example codes, highlighting the differences between MATLAB and Python, and showing also the things I struggled with. I hope you are motivated to learning Python as I am, and this can be an incentive to try it on your own.</p><p>I will update this first post to index the new examples I include as I go, so it is easier to navigate between the different entries.</p><p>Until the next one!</p><p>Luis</p><p></p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[That's it: I'm getting a more reliable 3D printer]]></title><description><![CDATA[Let me tell you about my journey with a cheap 3D printer.

It was the perfect fit for a small apartment, requiring a very reduced space to be installed on a desktop. I was really excited when it arrived, assembled it in 30 minutes, and started printing right away. The result of the first print turned out to be a decapitated version of the iconic Maneki-Neko cat, since the filament sample that came with the printer was not enough to complete the test .gcode file. I ended up modeling a head to fit the incomplete print and <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3709648">shared it online</a> so that other fellow makers could use it as well.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2022/07/de-capi-cat_1080.jpeg" class="kg-image" alt="That&apos;s it: I&apos;m getting a more reliable 3D printer" loading="lazy" width="1080" height="608" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2022/07/de-capi-cat_1080.jpeg 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1000/2022/07/de-capi-cat_1080.jpeg 1000w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2022/07/de-capi-cat_1080.jpeg 1080w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Although it was a cheap machine, the print quality was actually good!</figcaption></figure><p>At the time, all I wanted to do was to learn more about 3D printing, mod and upgrade my small Ender 2 and see how I could get the best out of such a cheap machine. I was still at university, completing my master&apos;s degree and I had just started working as a research assistant in the Aerosol Technology Laboratory. I had time to tinker around with the printer, right? </p><h3 id="i-had-no-idea-what-i-was-getting-into">I had no idea what I was getting into. </h3><hr><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2022/07/1656957694721.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="That&apos;s it: I&apos;m getting a more reliable 3D printer" loading="lazy"><figcaption>The printer quickly began spreading across the apartment and taking up all my time.</figcaption></figure><p><em><strong>The printer became a Frankenstein and a learning project for me</strong></em>. I switched the printer&apos;s 8-bit mainboard for a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XUQKQnUNig">32-bit aftermarket one</a>, upgraded the firmware, and installed a part-cooling fan and motor dampers: My first goal was to make it quieter. </p><p>Then I wanted to improve the print quality, so started buying other &quot;budget upgrades&quot;, &#xA0;like a Bondtech BMG knock-off from AliExpress. You see, all the parts I was installing were usually sourced from China, so they were cheap, and took ages to arrive. But buying cheap parts for a cheap printer meant that I wasn&apos;t spending much after all... right? After all, it was working just as well as a much more expensive printer. What&apos;s a couple of euros here and then to make the machine work better? A new print surface to improve bed adhesion. A new set of PTFE tube couplers because the original ones broke...</p><blockquote>But buying cheap parts for a cheap printer meant that I wasn&apos;t spending much after all... right? </blockquote><h3 id="reliability">Reliability</h3><p>It was all good until I started actually wanting to use the printer more consistently during the 2020 COVID-19 lockdown. I printed a bunch of parts for the laboratory I was working on - since we had the equipment, we rushed to provide pre-certification tests for community face masks. Precisely then, I started having serious problems with the prints not adhering to the print bed. I couldn&apos;t launch a print and walk away without having to check every 10 seconds on whether the first layer was OK or not. </p><p>I tried every imaginable solution and read every possible Reddit thread or forum entry about similar problems. Tried different filaments, with different temperatures. Tested different combinations of filaments and heated bed surfaces, and re-leveled the bed a million times. Until I figured out that the bed was warped, and I needed to compensate for that. So I installed an Auto Bed-Leveling Sensor (3D touch) which would probe the bed before each print to compensate for the warped bed. It only worked partially. Some sports were too close to the bed, some too far.</p><p>On top of that, the extrusion started to be very inconsistent. And for various reasons. Sometimes I would fix things by changing the <a href="https://all3dp.com/2/3d-slicer-settings-3d-printer/">slicer parameters</a>. But at some point, even slicer changes wouldn&apos;t help, and I started to find issues with hardware components. One time it was the hot-end heated cartridge not being able to provide enough power. Later on, the extruder gears started making some noise and I found out they were super worn out.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2022/07/cheap_parts.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="That&apos;s it: I&apos;m getting a more reliable 3D printer" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1000" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2022/07/cheap_parts.jpg 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1000/2022/07/cheap_parts.jpg 1000w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1600/2022/07/cheap_parts.jpg 1600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w2400/2022/07/cheap_parts.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Using cheap parts for any kind of machine will cause wear and damage that stacks up over time.&#xA0;</figcaption></figure><p>When I look back at the orders for upgrades and replacement components I made through AliExpress, Amazon, 3D Jake and eBay combined, I realize that the total is <strong>&#x20AC; 314</strong>!

I followed a bunch of <a href="https://teachingtechyt.github.io/calibration.html">useful online guides</a> and learned about how awesome the maker community is online. I now understand a lot more about how 3D printers work: the Marlin software, extruder types, motion systems, &#xA0;stepper motors, power supply units, and got a lot of experience with slicer parameters. It was really a ton of fun too.</p><p>So now, when someone asks me: &quot;should I get a 3D printer? How much should I spend on it?&quot;, the answer is, of course, a big: <em><strong>it depends</strong></em>. </p><p>What do you want to use it for? If you need consistency out of the box, maybe even a cheap Creality machine will do. If you need reliability and quality out of the box, you&apos;ll need a bigger budget for sure. </p><p>If you just want the printer for hobby use, then ask yourself: Do I want to tinker with the printer as a hobby, and am I willing to spend time learning about how it works? or do I want to use the printer to produce parts for my actual hobby?</p><p>That&apos;s where I made the decision to get a new one. Now I just need something to print consistently, since I no longer have all the time I had as a student. Plus, the Ender 2 has been discontinued, which means that replacement parts are no longer being produced. This is especially bad for the warped heated bed which had me struggling for the last couple of months. For reference, look at this plot I made with the data from a G29 command (the glass bed was installed!):</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><iframe width="900" height="450" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="test_mesh.html"></iframe><!--kg-card-end: html--><blockquote class="kg-blockquote-alt">For my current needs, I&apos;d rather have a printer that just works to make stuff for my actual hobbies.

Welcome to my blog"><p>Hi! As you might have guessed by the site name, my name is Luis and I make stuff when I am not working my full-time office job. I am a Mechanical and Automotive Engineering graduate, but I have always loved making things at home: sometimes just drawings, paintings, or small sculptures. And sometimes I do more technical stuff, like python scripts, small electronic projects with ESP8266 or ESP32, 3D printed objects... you get the idea. I make stuff.</p><p>People who have known me at different moments of my life might remember me for different aspects. For instance:</p><ul><li>In school, I used to be the guy doing hand sketches and drawings</li><li>During my first years of university, I was the guy obsessed with 3D CAD modeling</li><li>While completing my master&apos;s studies, I was the guy who wanted to learn everything about FEM stress analysis - and actually wrote my thesis almost 80% around that.</li></ul><p>But now, 2 years after graduating, I realize that what I really enjoy is learning new stuff and applying it to real problems. If you asked my friends from university almost none of them would think I&apos;d be interested in data analysis, electronics, sensors, IoT, and all that kinds of things. But here I am :) &#xA0;It&apos;s a random mix, for now.</p><p>I plan to use this site to share things that I have learned and little projects that I do in my spare time. Hopefully decently documented so you might find something useful or at least interesting. I might also share more engineering-related content about things I&apos;ve done in the past. There is a double-fold benefit for me: I also plan to use this to organize myself better and have a more structured way to actually complete the projects I start.</p><p>Now, from all the things I will post, about 80% are self-learned, and I am in absolutely no way an expert on any of the topics I will discuss here, but at least I will do my best to point you guys out to useful resources I used for learning myself.</p><p>I have been meaning to publish this for some time now, and I have finally done it (during a week of COVID-19 home isolation). </p><p>Wish me luck! and I hope you have a great day!</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
