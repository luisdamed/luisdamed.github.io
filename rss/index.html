It was the perfect fit for a small apartment, requiring a very reduced space to be installed on a desktop. I was really excited when it arrived, assembled it in 30 minutes, and started printing right away. The result of the first print turned out to be a decapitated version of the iconic Maneki-Neko cat, since the filament sample that came with the printer was not enough to complete the test .gcode file. I ended up modeling a head to fit the incomplete print and <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3709648">shared it online</a> so that other fellow makers could use it as well.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2022/07/de-capi-cat_1080.jpeg" class="kg-image" alt="That&apos;s it: I&apos;m getting a more reliable 3D printer" loading="lazy" width="1080" height="608" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2022/07/de-capi-cat_1080.jpeg 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1000/2022/07/de-capi-cat_1080.jpeg 1000w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2022/07/de-capi-cat_1080.jpeg 1080w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Although it was a cheap machine, the print quality was actually good!</figcaption></figure><p>At the time, all I wanted to do was to learn more about 3D printing, mod and upgrade my small Ender 2 and see how I could get the best out of such a cheap machine. I was still at university, completing my master&apos;s degree and I had just started working as a research assistant in the Aerosol Technology Laboratory. I had time to tinker around with the printer, right? </p><h3 id="i-had-no-idea-what-i-was-getting-into">I had no idea what I was getting into. </h3><hr><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2022/07/1656957694721.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="That&apos;s it: I&apos;m getting a more reliable 3D printer" loading="lazy"><figcaption>The printer quickly began spreading across the apartment and taking up all my time.</figcaption></figure><p><em><strong>The printer became a Frankenstein and a learning project for me</strong></em>. I switched the printer&apos;s 8-bit mainboard for a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XUQKQnUNig">32-bit aftermarket one</a>, upgraded the firmware, and installed a part-cooling fan and motor dampers: My first goal was to make it quieter. </p><p>Then I wanted to improve the print quality, so started buying other &quot;budget upgrades&quot;, &#xA0;like a Bondtech BMG knock-off from AliExpress. You see, all the parts I was installing were usually sourced from China, so they were cheap, and took ages to arrive. But buying cheap parts for a cheap printer meant that I wasn&apos;t spending much after all... right? After all, it was working just as well as a much more expensive printer. What&apos;s a couple of euros here and then to make the machine work better? A new print surface to improve bed adhesion. A new set of PTFE tube couplers because the original ones broke...</p><blockquote>But buying cheap parts for a cheap printer meant that I wasn&apos;t spending much after all... right? </blockquote><h3 id="reliability">Reliability</h3><p>It was all good until I started actually wanting to use the printer more consistently during the 2020 COVID-19 lockdown. I printed a bunch of parts for the laboratory I was working on - since we had the equipment, we rushed to provide pre-certification tests for community face masks. Precisely then, I started having serious problems with the prints not adhering to the print bed. I couldn&apos;t launch a print and walk away without having to check every 10 seconds on whether the first layer was OK or not. </p><p>I tried every imaginable solution and read every possible Reddit thread or forum entry about similar problems. Tried different filaments, with different temperatures. Tested different combinations of filaments and heated bed surfaces, and re-leveled the bed a million times. Until I figured out that the bed was warped, and I needed to compensate for that. So I installed an Auto Bed-Leveling Sensor (3D touch) which would probe the bed before each print to compensate for the warped bed. It only worked partially. Some sports were too close to the bed, some too far.</p><p>On top of that, the extrusion started to be very inconsistent. And for various reasons. Sometimes I would fix things by changing the <a href="https://all3dp.com/2/3d-slicer-settings-3d-printer/">slicer parameters</a>. But at some point, even slicer changes wouldn&apos;t help, and I started to find issues with hardware components. One time it was the hot-end heated cartridge not being able to provide enough power. Later on, the extruder gears started making some noise and I found out they were super worn out.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2022/07/cheap_parts.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="That&apos;s it: I&apos;m getting a more reliable 3D printer" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1000" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2022/07/cheap_parts.jpg 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1000/2022/07/cheap_parts.jpg 1000w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1600/2022/07/cheap_parts.jpg 1600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w2400/2022/07/cheap_parts.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Using cheap parts for any kind of machine will cause wear and damage that stacks up over time.&#xA0;</figcaption></figure><p>When I look back at the orders for upgrades and replacement components I made through AliExpress, Amazon, 3D Jake and eBay combined, I realize that the total is <strong>&#x20AC; 314</strong>! That is almost twice the price I paid for the printer itself, and it&apos;s not including the time I spent working on it, and reading online to figure out how to solve the problems I found.</p><h3 id="i-made-a-list-with-all-the-components-i-bought-for-the-printer-their-price-intended-use-and-how-effective-those-upgrades-were">I made a list with all the components i bought for the printer, their price, intended use, and how effective those upgrades were. </h3><p>Unfortunately, I have lost all the data I collected about noise levels, number of successful first layers, bed level meshes, and so on.

I followed a bunch of <a href="https://teachingtechyt.github.io/calibration.html">useful online guides</a> and learned about how awesome the maker community is online. I now understand a lot more about how 3D printers work: the Marlin software, extruder types, motion systems, &#xA0;stepper motors, power supply units, and got a lot of experience with slicer parameters. It was really a ton of fun too.</p><p>So now, when someone asks me: &quot;should I get a 3D printer? How much should I spend on it?&quot;, the answer is, of course, a big: <em><strong>it depends</strong></em>. </p><p>What do you want to use it for? If you need consistency out of the box, maybe even a cheap Creality machine will do. If you need reliability and quality out of the box, you&apos;ll need a bigger budget for sure. </p><p>If you just want the printer for hobby use, then ask yourself: Do I want to tinker with the printer as a hobby, and am I willing to spend time learning about how it works? or do I want to use the printer to produce parts for my actual hobby?</p><p>That&apos;s where I made the decision to get a new one. Now I just need something to print consistently, since I no longer have all the time I had as a student. Plus, the Ender 2 has been discontinued, which means that replacement parts are no longer being produced. This is especially bad for the warped heated bed which had me struggling for the last couple of months. For reference, look at this plot I made with the data from a G29 command (the glass bed was installed!):</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><iframe width="900" height="450" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="test_mesh.html"></iframe><!--kg-card-end: html--><blockquote class="kg-blockquote-alt">For my current needs, I&apos;d rather have a printer that just works to make stuff for my actual hobbies.

Welcome to my blog"><p>Hi! As you might have guessed by the site name, my name is Luis and I make stuff when I am not working my full-time office job. I am a Mechanical and Automotive Engineering graduate, but I have always loved making things at home: sometimes just drawings, paintings, or small sculptures. And sometimes I do more technical stuff, like python scripts, small electronic projects with ESP8266 or ESP32, 3D printed objects... you get the idea. I make stuff.</p><p>People who have known me at different moments of my life might remember me for different aspects. For instance:</p><ul><li>In school, I used to be the guy doing hand sketches and drawings</li><li>During my first years of university, I was the guy obsessed with 3D CAD modeling</li><li>While completing my master&apos;s studies, I was the guy who wanted to learn everything about FEM stress analysis - and actually wrote my thesis almost 80% around that.</li></ul><p>But now, 2 years after graduating, I realize that what I really enjoy is learning new stuff and applying it to real problems. If you asked my friends from university almost none of them would think I&apos;d be interested in data analysis, electronics, sensors, IoT, and all that kinds of things. But here I am :) &#xA0;It&apos;s a random mix, for now.</p><p>I plan to use this site to share things that I have learned and little projects that I do in my spare time. Hopefully decently documented so you might find something useful or at least interesting. I might also share more engineering-related content about things I&apos;ve done in the past. There is a double-fold benefit for me: I also plan to use this to organize myself better and have a more structured way to actually complete the projects I start.</p><p>Now, from all the things I will post, about 80% are self-learned, and I am in absolutely no way an expert on any of the topics I will discuss here, but at least I will do my best to point you guys out to useful resources I used for learning myself.</p><p>I have been meaning to publish this for some time now, and I have finally done it (during a week of COVID-19 home isolation). </p><p>Wish me luck! and I hope you have a great day!</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
